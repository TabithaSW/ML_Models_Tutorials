**Current Tutorials:**

- Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Learn how to build a basic image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with PyTorch and Tensorflow. We'll cover data preparation, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

- Decision Trees and Random Forests

Explore decision tree algorithms and ensemble methods like Random Forests for both classification and regression tasks. We'll walk through the implementation and visualization of decision trees using popular Python libraries.

**In Progress:**

- Regression Models

Understand regression analysis and how to apply linear regression, polynomial regression, and other regression techniques to predict continuous outcomes. We'll cover model fitting, evaluation metrics, and interpretation of results.

- Clustering Algorithms
  
Delve into unsupervised learning techniques such as K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. Learn how to identify patterns and group data points based on similarities.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- 
Discover the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how to preprocess text data, perform sentiment analysis, and build text classification models using techniques like bag-of-words and word embeddings.

- Time Series Forecasting

Master time series forecasting methods, including autoregressive models, moving averages, and LSTM networks. We'll show you how to analyze and predict sequential data such as stock prices and weather patterns.
